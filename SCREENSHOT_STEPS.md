# What to Look For in MongoDB Atlas

## Search For These Terms:

In your MongoDB Atlas dashboard, look for:
- 🔍 **"Network"**
- 🔍 **"IP Whitelist"**  
- 🔍 **"IP Access List"**
- 🔍 **"Allowed IPs"**
- 🔍 **"Whitelist"**

## Where It Usually Is:

### Left Sidebar:
```
- Clusters
- Database Access  ← User management
- Network Access   ← THIS ONE! ←
- Encryption
- Backup
```

### Top Navigation:
```
Security → Network Access
```

### Or in Settings:
```
... menu → Security → Network Whitelist
```

## What It Looks Like:

Once you find it, you'll see:
- List of IPs (might be empty)
- **Green "Add IP Address" button**
- Or **"Allow Access from Anywhere"** option

## If Still Can't Find:

Send me a screenshot of:
1. Your MongoDB Atlas dashboard (main screen)
2. Or the Security section

And I'll tell you exactly where to click!

**Quick test:** Can you see **"Database Access"** in sidebar?
If yes, Network Access is right next to it!
